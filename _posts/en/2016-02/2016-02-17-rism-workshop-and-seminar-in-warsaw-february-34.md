_The following has reached us from Sonia Wronkowska of [RISM Poland](/workgroups/poland-warsaw-polish-rism-center-national-library-of-poland.html):_

The workshop “Introduction to Kallisto” and a RISM seminar took place at the beginning of February in Warsaw, and was organised by the Polish RISM Centre (Music Department) and the Librarian Education Department of the [National Library of Poland](http://bn.org.pl/en/){:target="_blank"}. Sonia Wronkowska and Guido Kraus conducted the workshop.

Newcomers representing several institutions were present: the National Library, the [Institute of Musicology](http://www.imuz.uw.edu.pl/index.php/en/){:target="_blank"} and the Library of the Institute of Musicology - University of Warsaw, and the Museum and Library of the [Fryderyk Chopin National Institute](http://www.chopin.pl/nifc.en.html){:target="_blank"} participated in the workshop on the first day. The workshop was led by Sonia Wronkowska and consisted of an introduction to RISM, the cataloging program Kallisto, and some practice in creating simple bibliographic records. The second day was dedicated to more difficult topics, which also attracted advanced users. In addition to newcomers, RISM contributors from the Warsaw, Poznań, Wrocław and Lublin working groups attended the workshop and the seminar. Guido Kraus showed the function of authority databases in Kallisto and possibilities of adding multimedia files, such as watermark reproductions.

The RISM seminar was at the end of the second day, and aimed at the exchange of information about recent, current and planned projects in the Polish RISM working groups. It was also a presentation for newcomers to demonstrate what kind of use they can make of their Kallisto skills.

During the seminar 5 reports were presented by:
