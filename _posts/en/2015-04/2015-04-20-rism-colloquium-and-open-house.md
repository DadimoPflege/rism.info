We're in our fourth month at our new office, and it's time to celebrate!

Join us April 23-24 for our RISM colloquium and open house. The colloquium will feature reports from working groups. Our colleagues from Austria, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, South Korea, and the United Kingdom will join us to share the latest developments with their RISM projects.



The open house will be an opportunity for us to thank the people at the Universit√§t Frankfurt and the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz who made our move possible, and to show people around our new space.

A full program can be found on the [colloquium page](/publications/colloquium-2015.html "Opens internal link in current window").
