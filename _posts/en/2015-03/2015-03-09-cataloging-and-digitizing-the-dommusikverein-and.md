_The following announcement has reached us from our RISM colleagues in Austria:_



The International Mozarteum Foundation has started a new project in cooperation with the Archdioceses Archive in Salzburg. The goal is to catalog the valuable historical collection of the Dom-Musikverein und Mozarteum (Society for Music at the Cathedral and Mozarteum). This institution was founded in Salzburg in 1841 with the support of Mozart's widow Constanze. When this association split into the Dommusikverein and the Internationale Stiftung Mozarteum in 1880, the library holdings were also separated. This project will virtually reunite this historical and significant collection and major parts will also be digitized. Find out more on the Mozarteum's website ([German](https://mozarteum.at/bibliotheca-mozartiana/){:target="_blank"} and [English](https://mozarteum.at/en/bibliotheca-mozartiana/){:target="_blank"}).
