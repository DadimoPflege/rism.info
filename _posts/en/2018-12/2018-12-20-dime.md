On Friday, 14 December 2018, the Mozarteum Foundation Salzburg presented the new Digital Interactive Mozart Edition ([DIME](https://dme.mozarteum.at/musik/edition/)), which was developed in cooperation with the Packard Humanities Institute (PHI) in Los Altos, California/USA and RISM Switzerland. To this fully digital music edition, RISM Switzerland has contributed the tool [Verovio](https://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml), a self-developed software for the visualization of digitally encoded music. This allows to visualise immediately and interactiverly in the musical text the editorial interventions and all variants that exist between the sources encoded in [MEI](https://music-encoding.org).

DIME is a follow-up project to the new Mozart Edition (NMA), which was published since 1954 and has been available online since 2006. Based on the New Mozart Edition, DIME continues its scientific work developed over generations, but its content and its appearance are new.
