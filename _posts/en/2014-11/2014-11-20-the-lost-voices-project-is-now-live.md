The Lost Voices Project is now online:

[http://digitalduchemin.org/](http://digitalduchemin.org/)

"Focusing on a neglected but important repertory of polyphonic songs from mid-sixteenth-century France, this unique project puts old books before a diverse audience of modern scholars and musicians in ways that will prompt renewed understanding of these cultural artifacts and their meanings. It is dedicated to sixteen sets of books expertly crafted by the Parisian printer Nicolas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568. In them, we can trace changing literary tastes, musical fashions, and above all the impact of the relatively new medium of printing on musical culture of the day.

"Here readers will find facsimiles of all sixteen sets of books, plus modern transcriptions, scholarly commentaries, and tools for research."

The transcriptions have been encoded using [MEI](http://music-encoding.org/home){:target="_blank"}. Users can browse by book, pieces, and people. A variety of search options are also available. For each book, [RISM B/I](/publications.html#c2619) numbers are cited. Pieces include links to a modern edition, a sound recording, and a facsimile of the original source.

Interaction from other scholars is encouraged. Users can comment on pieces and view annotations made by other scholars. The project is open source and is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/deed.en_US), so scholars are free to share and adapt these materials.
