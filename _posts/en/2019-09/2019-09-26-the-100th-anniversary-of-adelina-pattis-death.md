As is revealed by the milestones of her life, Adelina Patti (1843–1919) was a genuine world star. Born the daughter of Italian parents in Madrid, Patti grew up in New York, was active mainly in London, and died 100 years ago tomorrow in Wales (Craig-y-Nos Castle). Her concert tours took her throughout Europe as well as to North, Central, and South America and the Caribbean. Patti was celebrated not only as a singer – especially in the roles of Amina (in Bellini's _La somnambula_), Lucia (in Donizetti's _Lucia di Lammermoor_), and Violetta (in Verdi's _La traviata_) – but also as an outstanding actress.

In RISM, her name can be found as a singer in two of these roles. In 1879, she gave guest performances in Dresden as [Violetta](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=270000996&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"} and [Lucia](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=270001056&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"}.

Lesser known is that Adelina Patti was also a composer. The RISM catalog only has one piece from her pen: The piano waltz [_Fior di primavera_](https://opac.rism.info/search?id=852036536&View=rism&Language=en){:target="_blank"} was published by Ricordi in 1866. Evidence of a further composition by her, [_Il Bacio d'addio_](https://www.digitalarchivioricordi.com/en/catalogo/40461){:target="_blank"}, can be found in the Ricordi Archive.
