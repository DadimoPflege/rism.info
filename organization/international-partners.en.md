# International Partners of the Project

## Professional Associations

RISM is sponsored under the auspices of two international professional associations:

* [IAML](http://www.iaml.info/ "IAML") – International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres
* [IMS](http://www.ims-online.ch/ "IMS") – International Musicological Society

## Commission Mixte

The Commission Mixte consists of ten members, five each from IAML and IMS. Together with the Board of the association, the Commission Mixte forms the executive committee that determines the strategic goals of the organization.

Members of the Commission Mixte are listed on the [Association](/organization/the-association.html) page.

## Advisory Council

The Council consists of all active members of the different working groups in all countries.

## Coordinating Committee

Five elected members from the Council form a Coordinating Committee. The Coordinating Committee facilitates communication between the working groups and the Zentralredaktion, conveys suggestions and requests between both sides, and encourages conversation among the working groups.

Members of the Coordinating Committee:

* Jeong Youn Chang (cataloger for RISM South Korea)
* Stefan Ikarus Kaiser (titular organist of Wilhering Abbey, Upper Austria)
* Zuzana Petrášková (National Library of the Czech Republic, head of the Department of Music)
