A new version of the RISM brochure is now available.

_RISM: An Overview_ is a 14-page, full-color brochure in English and German that describes RISM's goals, projects, and organization. It is available free of charge to anyone who is interested.

The brochure is available as a PDF on our [Publications page](/publications/brochures.html "Opens internal link in current window").

If you want professionally printed copies of the brochure, also at no charge, please contact us: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info). Let us know how many you want. Feel free to request some copies to share with your colleagues, other staff or faculty members, and students.

The new brochure has been updated with our new address and new Commission Mixte members. Moreover, it has a new orientation to reflect the recent addition of data from the A/I and B/I projects: now, the RISM online catalog documents musical sources from over 40 countries worldwide.
