At the beginning of June 2014, the first RISM library siglum for the Principality of Monaco was created: __MC-MCpgil, for the [Princess Grace IrishLibrary](http://www.pgil.mc/){:target="_blank"} in _Monaco-Ville._

The heart of the collection is made up of songs of Irish-American origin and Irish books. Many of the music scores were collected from 1932 to 1954 by Michael E. Oâ€™Donnell of Philadelphia, a collection which was acquired by Princess Grace in 1978. You can read more about the music collection in [an essay by Axel Klein](http://www.pgil.mc/princess-grace-s-collection-of-irish-american-sheet-music){:target="_blank"}.
