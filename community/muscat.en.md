# Muscat

{% include image file="/images/community/muscat.png" pos="right" %}

Muscat is RISM's central cataloging program for musical sources (manuscripts, printed music, libretti, and treatises). It is developed as an open-source project by the RISM under the leadership of the [RISM Digital Center](https://rism.digital){:target="_blank"} and in close collaboration with the Editorial Center and the working groups. For more information about the project, its philosophy and its history, visit the [Muscat Project](http://muscat-project.org/history.html){:target="_blank"} website.

## About Muscat

Muscat includes sources from the various RISM series A/I, A/II, and B/I, which are in one database for the first time after having previously been managed in separate places. As of September 2018, Muscat contains in total 1,132,000 musical sources, 111,700 authority records for personal names, 70,400 institutions, and 34,500 records for secondary literature.

Muscat is a multilingual, [open source](https://github.com/rism-ch/muscat){:target="_blank"}, web-based, platform-independent program. It uses MARC21 and thus has an internationally widespread and standardized data model at its core. Additional features include:
* Built-in version control to identify changes
* Ability to leave comments for sources and authority files
* Intuitive management of digital objects
* Ability to create folders to organize your work
* Link to VIAF to import personal name authority files
* Custom-built module to display incipits
* Expanded ability to add guidelines in different languages
* Integrated full online catalog search with geovisualizations
* Interfaces in English, German, French, and Italian, with translations in Spanish and Portuguese in preparation
* Separate training server for practice
