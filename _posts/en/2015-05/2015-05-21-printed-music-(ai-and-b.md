RISM is pleased to announce a major addition to its [free online catalog](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism){:target="_blank"} that strengthens its utility as a resource for the documentation of printed music. Two of its major publications have been added to the online catalog and are freely available online for anyone to search at [opac.rism.info](https://opac.rism.info/metaopac/start.do?View=rism){:target="_blank"} and [www.rism.info](http://www.rism.info/en/home.html){:target="_blank"}:

-

The entire contents of [A/I,](/publications.html#c36 "Opens internal link in current window")_[Individual Prints before 1800](/publications.html#c36 "Opens internal link in current window")_
Released on CD-ROM in 2012 and previously in 14 printed volumes

-

A portion of [B/I,](/publications.html#c2619 "Opens internal link in current window")_[Recueils imprimés, XVIe-XVIIe siècles](/publications.html#c2619 "Opens internal link in current window")_ (Printed collections of the 16th-17th centuries), covering the years 1500-1550



The addition of these printed sources brings the total number of records in the online catalog to over 1,010,000. New search fields allow users to search by **Publisher** , **A/I or B/I number** , and **Plate number**. Search results can be refined using the categories **Publisher** or a RISM **Series**. Icons of prints and manuscripts allow quick visual recognition.

We would like to express our gratitude to Bärenreiter and Henle Verlag for allowing us to incorporate the data into our catalog.

This addition of over 100,000 prints to the online catalog is an initial step towards revitalizing coverage of printed music in RISM. There are certainly many additions and corrections to be made to the A/I and B/I data and we ask for your patience as we work out a procedure for reporting new information. Institutions or individuals with additions or corrections to prints already in A/1 or B/1 are welcome to report them to us but for larger amounts of corrections, as well as new printed items without entries in A/1 or B/1, it will probably be easier to wait until the new cataloging program, Muscat, is available (expected in late 2015).

Any questions can be directed to: [contact@rism.info](mailto:contact@rism.info "Opens window for sending email")
