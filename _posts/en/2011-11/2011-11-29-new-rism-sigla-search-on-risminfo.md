The RISM library sigla are now [searchable on the RISM website](http://www.rism.info/en/community/development/rism-sigla-catalogue.html){:target="_blank"}. A new database was developed for this purpose and it supersedes the previous PDF publications. The initial inventory consists of 7,080 library sigla. The database is updated monthly. The search results lead users to individual entries in which the usual information can be found (such as institution name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, website) in addition to, if possible, a Google map with the location of the institution pinpointed. All institutions with holdings in the RISM online catalog are marked with a star on the results list. By clicking through to the record, you can jump directly to the online catalog to view the titles from that institution.

More information about the RISM library sigla can be found on the search page under [About Library Sigla](/sigla/about-sigla.html){:target="_blank"}. A [help text](/sigla/help.html){:target="_blank"} is also available.
