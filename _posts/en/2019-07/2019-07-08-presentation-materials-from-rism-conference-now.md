The first video recordings and presentations slides from RISM's conference "Works, Work Titles, Work Authorities: Perspectives on Introducing a Work Level in RISM," which took place in Mainz May 9-11, 2019, at the [Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur](http://www.adwmainz.de/){:target="_blank"}, are now online [and available through our conference website](/publications/introducing-a-work-level-in-rism-2019.html). More materials will be added as they arrive.

The RISM Central Office sought a dialogue between librarians and musicologists to discuss the idea of the musical work and how it can be applied to the data in the RISM database.

We would like to thank our colleagues at the Akademie for their technical assistance in editing the videos.

Below is the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9SyOIE9iSYLPn0EQZBux0YO4e-5R19Zn){:target="_blank"} of the videos we have so far:
