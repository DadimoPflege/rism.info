Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Christoph Wolff has been named Honorary President by the current RISM Board of Directors. While he was president of RISM from 2004-2013, he made outstanding contributions to the[Association](http://www.rism.info/en/organisation/the-association.html){:target="_blank"}.

First and foremost was the successful renewal of funding for the RISM Zentralredaktion by the Union der Deutschen Akademien, from 2008 to 2023. Another milestone was restructuring the Association. In a letter commending Dr. Wolff's accomplishments, current board president Dr. Wolf-Dieter Seiffert wrote, “You focused and strengthened the meaning of the Commission mixte and also created a new, helpful committee, the Advisory Council.” Among his many other important accomplishments was offering the data in the online catalog free of charge worldwide. This decisive step has led to a sharp increase in the worldwide importance and use of the RISM data.
