[The Registry of Research Data Repositories (re3data)](https://www.re3data.org/about){:target="_blank"} is a global registry that covers research data repositories from different academic disciplines. It presents repositories for the permanent storage and access of data sets to researchers, funding bodies, publishers, and scholarly institutions. re3data.org promotes a culture of sharing, increased access, and better visibility of research data.

We are pleased to announce that the RISM dataset has been added to the re3data repository (doi: [http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJMO6](http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJMO6){:target="_blank"}). The presence of the RISM data in re3data demonstrates RISMâ€™s commitment to open access data and helps other projects identify RISM as a potential suitable repository for their data.

Other music projects in re3data include the [Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music (DIAMM)](http://doi.org/10.17616/R3RR6G){:target="_blank"}, [Corpus Musicae Ottomanicae (CMO)](http://doi.org/10.17616/R31NJMJV){:target="_blank"} for Near East music manuscripts, the [Digital Scores and Libretti Collection](http://doi.org/10.17616/R3VC9R){:target="_blank"} from Harvard University, the Dutch [Beeld en Geluid](http://doi.org/10.17616/R3FD1B){:target="_blank"} sound archive, and the [Mutopia](http://doi.org/10.17616/R33P6W){:target="_blank"} project for free editions of classical compositions.
