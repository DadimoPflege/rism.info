The International Inventory of Musical Sources - RÃ©pertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) - is an international, non-profit organization which aims to comprehensively document extant musical sources worldwide: manuscripts, printed music, writings on music theory, and libretti that are found in libraries, archives, churches, schools, and private collections. RISM was founded in Paris in 1952 and is the largest and only global organization that documents written musical sources. RISM records what exists and where it can be found.
