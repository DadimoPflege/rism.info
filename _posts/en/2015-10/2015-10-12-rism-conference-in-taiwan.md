The 2015 Taipei Conference for a [Collaborative Project on Chinese Music Resources](http://archive.music.ntnu.edu.tw/master2015/){:target="_blank"}, organized by Chun-Zen Huang, will be held from October 15 to 16 at [National Taiwan Normal University](http://en.ntnu.edu.tw/){:target="_blank"} in order to try to set up a network of music repositories in the Chinese-speaking region (mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) that can contribute to RISM.

Klaus Keil will give a presentation about RISM and will also hold a workshop on how to catalog musical sources using our Kallisto cataloging program. Our colleague Hyun Kyung Chae from [RISM South Korea](http://ewha.kor.rism.info/index.php?id=528) is also among the presenters.

We are excited to have this opportunity to network with colleagues in Asia and are looking forward to fruitful collaboration with them.
