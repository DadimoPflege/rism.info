From the [AMS](http://www.ams-net.org/){:target="_blank"} we have received the following announcement:

We are pleased to announce the availability of a new online resource, Mozart: New Documents. The site will present recently uncovered references to Mozart and his music from the composer's lifetime that have yet to appear in the scholarly literature. Many documents have been located through the expanded search opportunities of large-scale digitization projects such as Google Books, while others have been located using traditional methods.

Over 30 documents are now available, and we expect to add a further 60 over the coming months. For each document we present a facsimile (where available), a transcription, and commentary. Among the highlights are reports of the premieres of _Le nozze di Figaro_ and _Cosi fan tutte_, a previously unknown concert given by Mozart in 1787, and a name-day serenade in Vienna in 1789 featuring Mozart's "latest symphonies."

The site is a work in progress, and we welcome corrections and notifications of further material.
