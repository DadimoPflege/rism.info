As you all know, our new cataloging program [Muscat was released last week](http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsdetails/article/2/welcome-muscat.html){:target="_blank"}, and excitement for the new program continues to grow. Following workshops in [Frankfurt](http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsdetails/select/events/article/2/countdown-to-muscat.html){:target="_blank"}, Berlin, [Warsaw](http://www.rism.info/en/home/newsdetails/select/events/article/2/muscat-workshop-in-warsaw.html){:target="_blank"}, and Seoul, an additional workshop was held last week at the [National Library in Prague](http://www.en.nkp.cz/){:target="_blank"}.

From November 14 to 16, Guido Kraus of the RISM Central Office introduced around fifteen participants to Muscat. The workshop attendees were from the National Library (CZ-Pu), the Moravian Museum in Brno (CZ-Bm), and the Slovak National Museum in Bratislava (SK-BRnm). The focus of the workshop was on the structure of the program, its functions, one's own data management, and not least data input. The new cataloguing program Muscat as a very useful tool for music cataloguing will lead us to fruitful international cooperation.
